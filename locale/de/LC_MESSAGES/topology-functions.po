"The pgRouting's topology of a network, represented with an edge table with "
"source and target attributes and a vertices table associated with it. "
"Depending on the algorithm, you can create a topology or just reconstruct "
"the vertices table, You can analyze the topology, We also provide a function"
" to node an unoded network."
