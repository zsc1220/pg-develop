"The analyses of one way segments is pretty simple but can be a powerful "
"tools to identifying some the potential problems created by setting the "
"direction of a segment the wrong way. A node is a `source` if it has edges "
"the exit from that node and no edges enter that node. Conversely, a node is "
"a `sink` if all edges enter the node but none exit that node. For a `source`"
" type node it is logically impossible to exist because no vehicle can exit "
"the node if no vehicle and enter the node. Likewise, if you had a `sink` "
"node you would have an infinite number of vehicle piling up on this node "
"because you can enter it but not leave it."

"So why do we care if the are not feasible? Well if the direction of an edge "
"was reversed by mistake we could generate exactly these conditions. Think "
"about a divided highway and on the north bound lane one segment got entered "
"wrong or maybe a sequence of multiple segments got entered wrong or maybe "
"this happened on a round-about. The result would be potentially a `source` "
"and/or a `sink` node."

"So by counting the number of edges entering and exiting each node we can "
"identify both `source` and `sink` nodes so that you can look at those areas "
"of your network to make repairs and/or report the problem back to your data "
